There are $n$ different types of cakes, 
and the weight of a piece of the $i$-th type of cakes is $w_i$ grams.
Assume we have an unlimited supply of each kind of cakes.

$q$ monsters are hungry, and Cindy will feed them with cakes.
The monsters never waste, so they will eat entire piece of cake.
The monsters are curious, so they prefer to eat different types of cakes. 
Every monster eat any type of cakes at most one piece. 
That is, no monster eat two or more pieces of any one type of cakes.
Each monster has its own preference on cakes.
The $j$-th monster hates the $x_j$-th type of cakes, so
the $j$-th monster never eats the $x_j$-th type of cakes.
With the above contraints, it is not hard to observe that every monster will 
eat a subset of the $n$ types of cakes. Moreover, every monster eats exactly
one piece of each type in the subset. 

To keep the monster happy, Cindy must feed the $j$-th monster with 
exactly $W_j$ grams of cakes. If the $j$-th monster does not have exactly $W_j$
grams of cake or Cindy feeds the $j$-th monster with the $x_j$-th type of cakes,
then the $j$-th monster will become angry.
Cindy wonders how many different sets of cakes she can feed the $j$-th monster 
without make it angry.

Please write a program to help Cindy.
