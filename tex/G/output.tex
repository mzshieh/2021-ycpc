print $n$ floating number, the $i$th number indicates the minimal length of fences if Alice wants to use the $i$th  wood pile as one of the vertices in her garden.
If it is impossible to fence up her garden with the $i$-th  wood pile, please print $-1$.
The answer is considered as correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{−6}$.
Namely, if your answer is $a$, and the jury's answer is $b$, then your answer is accepted, if $\frac{|a-b|}{max(1,|b|)}\leq 10^{-6}$
