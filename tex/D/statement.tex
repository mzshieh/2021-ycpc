A multiset of two elements $\{x, y\}$ is a good pair if $x=y$.
A multiset of three elements $\{x,y,z\}$ is a good triple 
if $x=y=z$ or $\{x,y,z\} = \{\min(x,y,z),\min(x,y,z)+1,\min(x,y,z)+2\}$.
In this problem, 
a partition of a multiset $S$ is a set $P$ of subsets of $S$ such that
$\bigcup_{p\in P}p = S$ and $\sum_{p\in P}|p| = |S|$.
A partition $P$ of a multiset $S$ of $3n+2$ elements is a good if 
the following hold.
\begin{itemize}
\item $P$ contains exactly one good pair.
\item $P$ contains exactly $n$ good triples.
\end{itemize}

Given a positive integer $n$ and a multiset $S$ of $3n+2$ elements where
every element in $S$ \emph{repeats at most four times} in $S$.
Please write a program to determine whether one can decompose $S$ 
into a good partition.
