Our world is spherical, but the world of Flatland is flat! 
In Flatland, the ground is flat without any curvature, 
and everywhere has the same height.
However, the mobile communication in Flatland and in our world are quite 
similar.
The mobile phone must be in the signal coverage of some base station.
Otherwise, the phone cannot communicate with the others.

Mark is a wise Flatlander living in the rural area.
He knows there is only one base station in the area where he is living.
One day, he finds that
the shape of signal coverage of that base station is a ball!
Such shape is unusual in Flatland, because a ball is perfectly spherical!
Mark wants to figure out the boundary of the signal coverage, 
but he can only move on the ground.
He first moves from his house to the east and finds that his mobile phone is out of service
after $E$ kilometers. 
Then, he moves from his house to the west/south and finds that his mobile phone is out of 
service after $W$/$S$ kilometers, respectively.

After learning the numbers $E$, $W$, and $S$, 
Mark says ``Ahh! Now I know the signal coverage of the base station!''
Mary, Mark's sister, wonders if Mark really knows. 
She asks Mark ``If you move from your house to the north, after how many 
kilometers, your mobile phone will be out of service?''

Could you compute the answer for Mary to check whether his brother can
answer her correctly?
